## Author Ophelia Dong 

### About the Author 
My name is Ophelia Dong. I am a fourth year student majoring in Statistics and European Language Transcultural Studies, French. I am interested in the intersection between data, programming and humanities. 

### Course Description
DH140 is taught by Professor Winjum. It is a coding class based on python. The class material spans from basic python programming techniques to methods that one can use code to represent humanity subjects. 

### My Course Objective 
My project for the class is to find interesting angles to program humanity topics, such as music, literature, opera, etc. Besides showing graphs, videos, websites, what other form of representation can I create using python?
